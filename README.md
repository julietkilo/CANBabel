# CANBabel

## Overview

CANBabel is a conversion tool for CAN database files. It was created because most CAN databases are stored in proprietary formats that are not documented and can not be used for free.
The open source CAN analysis tool [**Kayak**](https://github.com/dschanoeh/Kayak/ "Kayak is an application for CAN bus diagnosis and monitoring") introduced a new and well documented XML based format: KCD (file suffix .kcd). [**KCD**](https://github.com/julietkilo/kcd) is the acronym for Kayak CAN definition.
Initially **CANBabel** supported only conversion from the .dbc format to the .kcd format but the goal is to provide a tool that supports many formats.

In 2018 CANBabel has been completely revised to support databases containing CAN-FD messages.

## Supported formats
Currently the following formats are supported (Read/Write):

* Kayak CAN Definition (.kcd) (Read/Write)
* Vector (.dbc) (Read)

## Build instructions
You will need a current Java JDK and Maven to build **CANBabel**. After cloning the repository just type
	$ mvn clean install
and maven will fetch all dependencies and build a **CANBabel** jar-file in the /target folder of your workspace. You can also just add the repository in your favorite Java IDE as a new _maven project_.

## Run CANBabel
In most environments it's simply required to doubleclick the jar-file in a file browser. If not try the commandline <code>java -jar CANBabel-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>
